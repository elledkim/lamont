    <h2>Welcome to the Lamont Sanctuary Forest</h2>
    <p>
      The Lamont Sanctuary Forest is a 9.3-hectare second-growth hardwood forest located on the Columbia University Lamont campus in Palisades, NY. Once active cropland nearly 200 years ago, the area has since reforested naturally and now supports a mature, biodiverse ecosystem that reflects both human land-use history and natural recovery. This living landscape is an invaluable resource for environmental monitoring, long-term ecological research, and climate-related education.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forest canopy is dominated by oak, hickory, beech, and maple species, while the understory hosts a rich variety of shrubs and herbaceous plants. Seasonal changes transform the forest dramatically—from verdant spring blooms to vibrant autumn foliage—offering a dynamic and visually striking setting for fieldwork. This site provides critical insights into forest resilience, biodiversity, and the role of rewilded landscapes in the carbon cycle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lamont has served as a center for long-term ecological research since the 1980s. Permanent forest monitoring plots have tracked changes in species composition, growth patterns, and tree mortality over four decades. These plots contribute to larger collaborative networks, such as the Smithsonian ForestGEO, and offer a detailed, time-rich dataset for understanding forest dynamics in the northeastern U.S.
    </p>

    <h2>Soil Carbon & Climate Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      Soils contain more carbon than the atmosphere and all vegetation combined—about 1,500 Pg to 1 meter depth, and 2,400 Pg to 2 meters. This makes soil one of the most powerful climate regulators on Earth. Protecting and restoring soil carbon stocks through natural climate solutions is both scalable and cost-effective. In fact, soil carbon accounts for 25% of the potential of all natural climate solutions, with substantial overlap across forest, wetland, and agricultural systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this context, carbon sequestration refers to the long-term storage of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere into stable organic matter within the soil. The Lamont Sanctuary Forest provides a vital testbed for tracking these carbon fluxes and validating soil carbon models through real-world data.

    <h2>Research and Education at Lamont</h2>
    <p>
      Since the spring of 2024, Lamont’s research scope has expanded to include intensive soil carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) monitoring, marking the start of a multi-year soil sampling campaign. The site has been outfitted with digital soil profile (DSP) plots, and spatially distributed sampling points have been added across topographic and vegetation gradients.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the summer of 2024, high school, undergraduate, and graduate students participated in the Lamont Summer Internship Program, contributing to dense field sampling and data collection. These student-driven projects are now foundational to ongoing efforts to model soil carbon stocks, quantify carbon sequestration potential, and link above- and belowground carbon dynamics.

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      The Lamont Sanctuary Forest is more than a research plot—it's a model for interdisciplinary, community-driven science. As global climate challenges escalate, Lamont’s work offers local-scale solutions rooted in empirical data and hands-on education. With its long history of monitoring, its new soil carbon infrastructure, and its proximity to urban centers, Lamont is uniquely positioned to drive insights into the future of forest-based climate mitigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Future work will continue to integrate soil health indicators, remote sensing data, and modeling frameworks to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of nature-based solutions in mitigating climate change. The forest, like the students and scientists who study it, is growing into a powerful resource for discovery, resilience, and hope.
